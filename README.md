# Diffie-Hellman
This project is an implementation of the Diffie Hellman key exchange method used for symmetric key cryptography in the Python programming language.

This project is Implemented in two ways:

                 #1:
                   --> As a Jupyter notebook for code comprehension and readability
                 #2:
                   --> As a simple python file for easier code implementation and execution
              
              
 The objective of this project is of personal interest in discovering the basic methods of cryptography
